            <h3>🌟Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout this course, I learned the basic concepts of IT and how it’s used in organisations to manage data, design systems, and support daily tasks. I also got a clearer understanding of hardware, software, networking, and how information systems help with real decision-making. The previous PC Assembly Lab gave me a real hands-on experience, helping me and my classmates understand how each PC component works together in a system. I hope we’ll have more practical sessions like that in the future. On top of that, I also enjoyed the PPG Industry Talk because it gave us real examples of IT jobs, the skills needed, and possible career paths. Overall, this course helped me see how important IT is in different fields, and it motivated me to keep improving my skills and learn how to use them in real-life situations.
